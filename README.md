Welcome. 
This is the website for the virtual Software Metadata Publication organization (*software-metadata.pub*).

software-metadata.pub is an umbrella for projects in the software metadata publication space,
run by a [consortium](#consortium) of research organizations within the [Helmholtz Association](https://www.helmholtz.de/).

## Projects

[![HERMES logo](hermes-logo.png)](https://hermes.software-metadata.pub)

> **HERMES** workflows enable automated publication of rich research software metadata and artifacts to publication repositories using open source tooling.

- Learn more on the [HERMES website](https://hermes.software-metadata.pub).

### Software CaRD: Helmholtz Rich Metadata Software Publication

> **Software CaRD** (*Software Curation and Reporting Dashboard*) is an open source application that presents software publication metadata for curation. Preprocessed metadata from automated pipelines are made accessible in a structured graphical view, with highlighted issues and conflicts. Software CaRD also assesses metadata for compliance with configurable policies, and lets users track and visualize relevant metadata for evaluation and reporting.
